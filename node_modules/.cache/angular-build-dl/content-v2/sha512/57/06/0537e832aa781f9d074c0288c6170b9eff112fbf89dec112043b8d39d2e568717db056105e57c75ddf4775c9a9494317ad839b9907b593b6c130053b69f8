If the activity you registered for has a refund policy, you'll find\n    it posted\n    on the activity detail where you registered and the order confirmation email you received after purchasing. Eligible\n    refund requests that fall within the host's posted refund policy should be honored. However, refund requests that\n    are not eligible under the host's posted refund policy will be addressed at the discretion of the host.\n  </p>\n  <br>\n  <h3 class=\"fontstyle2\">\n    Refund guidelines\n  </h3>\n  <br>\n  <p>\n    <li>\n      Not all hosts set a refund policy, so if you don't see a refund policy posted on the activity details or your\n      order confirmation,\n      you can simply submit a refund request.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n      If your activity was postponed or canceled, please submit a refund request or contact the host and select\n      \"activity cancelled\"\n      for the reason. Choosing the right refund reason will help the host address your request appropriately.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n      Our goal is that host and attendees resolve any refund requests on their own.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n      Our host should respond within 1 week and when issued, refunds can take up to 5 business days to show on your\n      wallet.\n    </li>\n  </p>\n  <br>\n  <h3 class=\"fontstyle2\">\n    Host’s Refund policies\n  </h3>\n  <br>\n  <div>\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n        <h4>\n          No Refunds:\n        </h4>\n        <p>\n          \"No Refunds\" means that the activity host does not grant refunds for this activity. You can't submit a refund\n          request for\n          your order, but you can still contact the host with questions. Depending on the host's activity settings,\n          you may still be able to change the name on your order, transfer your tickets to someone else or transfer\n          to a different activity hosted by the same host.\n        </p>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <h4>\n          Refunds up to 1 day before activity:\n        </h4>\n        <p>\n          \"Refunds up to 1 day before activity\" means that the activity host grants refunds up until one day before the\n          start date\n          of the activity.
